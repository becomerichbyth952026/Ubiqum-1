        <h1>TIME TRIALS SAFETY RULES</h1>
        <h3>We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America</h3>

    </head>

    <body>
        <p>
            Motorsports are inherently dangerous.These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or<br>
            death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using<br>
            superior safety gear, paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials.<br>
            Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for<br>
            operation under elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a<br>
            Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA Official
           </p>
           <p>
            Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the<br>
            best protection that current technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint<br>
            systems, roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety<br>
            required by these Rules. In these cases, there are two additional Safety Levels.

                                    A roll bar is defined as a main hoop and diagonal placed behind the driver and supplemented<br />
                                    by two braces. The roll bar must be designed to withstand compression forces resulting from<br />
                                    the weight of the car coming down on the roll structure, and to take fore-and-aft loads resulting<br />
                                    from the car skidding along the ground on the roll structure. The basic purpose of the roll bar is<br />
                                    to protect the driver in case the vehicle rolls over. Roll bars must meet the following criteria:

                                            All roll bars must be braced in a manner to prevent movement in a fore-and-aft direction with<br />
                                            the braces attached within the top third of the roll hoop. At a minimum, two (2) braces must be<br />
                                            used, parallel to the sides of the car, and placed at the outer extremities of the roll bar hoop.<br />
                                            Such braces should extend to the rear whenever possible. Diagonal lateral bracing must be<br />
                                            installed to prevent lateral distortion of the hoop. In most cases, a lateral brace from the bottom<br />
                                            corner of the hoop on the side to the top corner of the hoop on the other side is sufficient.<br />
                                            Although installing the diagonal lateral brace in the main hoop is the strongest alternative (and<br />
                                            hence most preferable), there may be instances where such an installation is not practical. In<br />
                                            such situations, the installation of the diagonal brace running from the bottom of the fore/aft<br />
                                            brace on one side to the top corner of the hoop on the other side is acceptable. In convertible<br />

                                            also known as a “double diagonal” used between the rear supports is acceptable.

                                            Removable roll bars and braces must be very carefully designed and constructed to be at<br />
                                            least as strong as a permanent installation. If one (1) tube fits inside another tube to facilitate<br />
                                            removal, the removable portion must fit tightly and must bottom on the permanent mounting,<br />
                                            and at least two (2) bolts must be used to secure each telescope section. The telescope section<br />
                                            must be at least eight inches in length. One (1) bolt is required if one (1) end is welded to the<br />
                                            main hoop.

                                            In the case of cars with unitized or frameless construction, mounting plates may be used<br />
                                            to secure the roll bar structure to the car floor. The important consideration is that the load be<br />
                                            distributed over as large an area as possible. A backing plate of equal size and thickness must be<br />

                                            of a back-up plate of equal size and thickness on the opposite side of the panel with the plates<br />
                                            through-bolted together is recommended. A minimum of three (3) bolts per plate is required for<br />

                                            possible, the mounting plate should extend onto a vertical section of the structure, such as a door pillar.
