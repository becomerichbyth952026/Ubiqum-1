        <p>
            Motorsports are inherently dangerous.These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or
            death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using
            superior safety gear, paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials.<br>
            Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for
            operation under elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a
            Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA Official<br>
           </p>
           <p>
            Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the
            best protection that current technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint
            systems, roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety
            required by these Rules. In these cases, there are two additional Safety Levels.

                                            The roll bar hoop and all braces must be of seamless or DOM mild steel tubing (SAE 1010,
                                            1020, 1025) or equivalent, or alloy steel tubing (SAE 4130). For cars logbooked before 1/1/16,
                                            existing ERW tubing is acceptable.

                                            All welding should be of the highest possible quality with full penetration. Craters should be
                                            filled to the cross section of the weld and undercut be no more than 0.01 inch deep.

                                            All roll bars must be braced in a manner to prevent movement in a fore-and-aft direction with
                                            the braces attached within the top third of the roll hoop. At a minimum, two (2) braces must be
                                            used, parallel to the sides of the car, and placed at the outer extremities of the roll bar hoop.
                                            Such braces should extend to the rear whenever possible. Diagonal lateral bracing must be
                                            installed to prevent lateral distortion of the hoop. In most cases, a lateral brace from the bottom
                                            corner of the hoop on the side to the top corner of the hoop on the other side is sufficient.
                                            Although installing the diagonal lateral brace in the main hoop is the strongest alternative (and
                                            hence most preferable), there may be instances where such an installation is not practical. In
                                            such situations, the installation of the diagonal brace running from the bottom of the fore/aft
                                            brace on one side to the top corner of the hoop on the other side is acceptable. In convertible
                                            vehicles with a production line beginning 1990 or later, such as the Mazda Miata, a “V” design,
                                            also known as a “double diagonal” used between the rear supports is acceptable.

                                            Removable roll bars and braces must be very carefully designed and constructed to be at
                                            least as strong as a permanent installation. If one (1) tube fits inside another tube to facilitate
                                            removal, the removable portion must fit tightly and must bottom on the permanent mounting,
                                            and at least two (2) bolts must be used to secure each telescope section. The telescope section
                                            must be at least eight inches in length. One (1) bolt is required if one (1) end is welded to the
                                            main hoop.

                                            Roll bars and braces must be attached to the frame of the car wherever possible. Mounting

                                            In the case of cars with unitized or frameless construction, mounting plates may be use
                                            to secure the roll bar structure to the car floor. The important consideration is that the load be
                                            distributed over as large an area as possible. A backing plate of equal size and thickness must be
                                            used on the opposite side of the panel with the plates through-bolted together.

                                            of a back-up plate of equal size and thickness on the opposite side of the panel with the plates
                                            through-bolted together is recommended. A minimum of three (3) bolts per plate is required for
                                            bolted mounting plates.

                                            possible, the mounting plate should extend onto a vertical section of the structure, such as a door pillar.

                            It is intended that Safety Level 3 be similar to that of SCCA Road Racing. Vehicles of
                            motorsports-specific construction are required to meet these specifications. For National Time
                            Trial Events, vehicles prepared beyond Max Category Rules and competing on tires without
                            DOT-Approval must meet Safety Level 3 Standards.

                            All Safety Level 3 vehicles must meet the requirements of Safety Levels 1 and 2, plus the
                            inclusion of a roll cage compliant with specifications listed here. A roll cage consists of the main
                            hoop, front hoop, side protection, and braces as specified in these Rules.
