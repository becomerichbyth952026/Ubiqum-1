        <h1>TIME TRIALS SAFETY RULES</h1>
        <h3>We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America</h3>

    </head>

        <p>
            Motorsports are inherently dangerous.These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or<br>
            death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using<br>
            superior safety gear, paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials.<br>
            Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for<br>
            operation under elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a<br>
            Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA Official
           </p>
           <p>
            Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the<br>
            best protection that current technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint<br>
            systems, roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety<br>
            required by these Rules. In these cases, there are two additional Safety Levels.
