   <h1>TIME TRIALS SAFETY RULES</h1>
   <h3>We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America</h3>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>
    Motorsports are inherently dangerous.These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or<br>
    death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using<br>
    superior safety gear, paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials.<br>
    Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for<br>
    operation under elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a<br>
    Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA Official
   </p>
   <p>
    Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the<br>
    best protection that current technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint<br>
    systems, roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.
   </p>
   <p>
    National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety<br>
    required by these Rules. In these cases, there are two additional Safety Levels.

          <li><b>Convertibles</b>
          <ol>
          <p>It is highly recommended that all convertible vehicles be equipped with an aftermarket roll bar<br />
          that meets or exceeds the standards set in the Time Trials Safety Standard Level 2 (see<br />
          below). However, minimum safety standards requires the vehicle meets at least one of the<br />
          following criteria and is not subject to any of the listed exceptions</p>
          </ol></li>

          </ol>  

            <ol>
                <li><b>Convertible vehicles up to and including the 2005 model year</b> must have rollover<br />
                      protection meeting one of the following criteria:
                  <ol type="A">
                  <p><li>The vehicle is equipped with documented factory installed roll over protection. (Examples of<br />
                       manufacturer-documented roll over protection include hydroformed and reinforced a-pillars or<br />
                       windshield frame and factory installed roll<br />
                       bars and/or “pop-up” bars that are designated as roll over protection.)</li></p>

                  <p><li>The vehicle is equipped with a commercially produced roll bar or roll cage which is described<br />
                       by the manufacturer to provide track-appropriate rollover protection. (E.g., “style” bars are not<br />
                       acceptable.)</li></p>

                  <p><li>. The vehicle is equipped with a roll bar that meets the Safety Level 2 standards for material<br />
                      and construction.</li></p>
            </ol></li> 

        </ol>

        <li><b>Convertible vehicles of the 2006 model year or later</b> must have a roll bar that meets<br />
            the Safety Level 2 standards for material and construction unless one of the following criteria is<br />
            met.</li>
